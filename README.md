This project was really fun. Took me few days though!
Not sure if I learned much new concepts, but definetly few little tricks here and there, and I'm now way more confident in using some of the things I already knew. Using the word "knew" vary vaguely. More like concepts I 'knew existed and had a small idea what it is supposed to do.'

Still struggling a little bit with the Flexbox. I know the basics, but still rely on (probably) excessive use of margins and paddings to align my stuff. But I guess it's normal at this point and something you get better at as you progress.

This project was some what of a turning point, first time I actually feel that with practice I might have what it takes to become a developer of sorts.
